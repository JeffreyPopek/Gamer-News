    <p> The newest expansion (Rise of the Shadows) has been released for heathstone on April 9th and it has added a lot of new things including 135 new cards including Lackeys, Schemes, the new Twinspell keyword, and much more! Also there will be a brand new single-player experience coming shortly after Rise of Shadows launches. Blizzard also offered 2 bundles avalible for purchase before the expansion came out. These 2 bundles were Rise of Shadows bundle which costed you $49.99 and came with 50 Rise of Shadows card packs, the Jewel of Lazul card back, and a random Legendary from Rise of Shadows, and the second Rise of Shadows Bundle (Rise of the Shadows Mega Bundle) which costed $79.99 and came with 80 Rise of the Shadows card packs, the Jewel of Lazul card back, a random Legendary from Rise of the Shadows, and Madame Lazul, the Priest Hero. There is also a free Legendary that you get just for logging in to the game which you get before the expansion even comes out, its name is Archmage Vargoth and the card reads "At the end of your turn, cast a spell youâ€™ve cast this turn (targets are random)". You can see all the new cards <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/expansions-adventures/rise-of-shadows/cards" target="blank" style="color:skyblue"> here </a>. In the new update for hearthstone there is a special offer that if you log in for a short period of time (around Easter) you will get 2 free packs and get 2 copies of an egg card (the two cards are also golden which and be sold of more dust).</a></p>
