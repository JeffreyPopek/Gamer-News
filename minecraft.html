    The new update for minecraft, Java Edition 1.14, comes out April 23rd 2019 and will bring a ton of new items to the game including Bamboo, Pillagers, and much more! The new update is called the "Village & Pillage" update and brings new mobs called Pillagers which are similar to Villagers but instead of trading with you, Pillagers invade villages and pillage them. They ride on another new mob called the "Pillager's Beast". The Beast will invade a village with the Pillagers and trample the Villager's crops but won't destroy blocks. When the Pillagers invade villages they carry a new weapon called the Crossbow. The crossbow is very similar to the Bow, you need to pull the arrow back and press right click again to shoot out an arrow. You can also shoot fireworks out of the Crossbow. Other than the Pillagers, Crossbows, and Pillager's Beasts, Hereâ€™s a list of the new items and features they added in to the game: bamboo, pandas, foxes, new village updates, suspicious stew, crossbows, cats, barrels, bells, blast furnace, grindstone, lantern, lectern, loom, scaffolding, smithing table, smoker, stonecutter, sweet  berry bushes, colored signs, jigsaw block, fletching tables, composter, cartography tables, leather horse armor, brown mooshrooms, ravager, wandering trader, trader llama, pillager outpost, bad omen effect, and hero of the village effect. The hero of the village effect happens when you save a village from a Pillager raid. When you get the effect you can talk to any villager and depending on their class they will gift you different items. The Armorer villager will gift you a full set of Chain-mail, the Butcher will gift you some cooked meat, the Cartographer will gift you a map, the Cleric will gift you redstone or lapis, the Farmer will give you a cookie, pumpkin pie, or bread, the Fisherman will gift you fish, the Fletcher will gift you some of the status effect arrows, the Leatherworker gifts you leather, the Librarian gifts you a book, the Mason gifts you clay, the Shepherd will gift you colored wool, the Toolsmith will gift you stone tools, and finally the Weaponsmith will give you a iron, stone, or gold axe.
